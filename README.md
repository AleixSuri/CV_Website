Project analysis:
o Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she
expected to find in your project?

o Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis is basically the distribution of the different
sections of the CV on the page

o Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography?
Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects
